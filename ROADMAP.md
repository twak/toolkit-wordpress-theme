Roadmap
=======

## High Priority

- Restrict Tiny MCE and HTML Input controls for users
- Change the restrictions on titles to be more like Twitter
- Page password protection
- Create Trello board for WP development

## Low Priority

- Image Gallery
- Contact Forms (governance / change to Gravity Forms?)
- Look at templates with / without sidebar. Maybe change into separate templates?

## Nice to Have's

- Multiple authors on events

## Requires Investigation

- WordPress sidebar navigation
- Links appearance on mobile
