## Next release

 * Implement page widgets as ACF code (rather than linked JSON).
 * Add options to theme settings for:
    1. Show Twitter avatar (checkbox, default: false)
    2. Show/hide ACF UI in admin (checkbox, default false, admins only)
    3. Add option for more colours
 * Create custom taxonomies for News and Events
 * Add columns to News and Events admin pages
 * Add hooks to templates
 * Add some options for Events display, and rationalise the order on the main events archive page
 * Make templates in plugins overridable by the theme and child themes

## Future developments

 * Implement more design patterns from toolkit as page widgets
 * Implement image galleries using wordpress Gallery tied to design pattern (with additional options for gallery insertion for different patterns)
